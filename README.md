Unity Project.
Created a calming scene for VR users to sit, relax, and watch a live movement of the stars and sun.
With Sky whales & fish. Jellyfish moving next to the user. All while accompanied by their pet ferret/cat.

This was a project during my studies at HyperIsland for the World in 3D course. Full marks.
